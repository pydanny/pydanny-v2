title: Why Doesn't Python Have Switch/Case?
---

[![Aliens](images/aliens.png)](/static/aliens.png)

Unlike every other programming language I've used before, Python does
not have a switch or case statement. To get around this fact, we use
dictionary mapping:

``` python
def numbers_to_strings(argument):
    switcher = {
        0: "zero",
        1: "one",
        2: "two",
    }
    return switcher.get(argument, "nothing")
```

This code is analogous to:

``` javascript
function(argument){
    switch(argument) {
        case 0:
            return "zero";
        case 1:
            return "one";
        case 2:
            return "two";
        default:
            return "nothing";
    };
};
```

While the Python code is often more terse than the standard method of
handling cases, I could argue it is more arcane. When I first started
Python it felt weird and distracting. Over time it grew on me, the use
of a dictionary key being the identifier in a switch becoming more and
more habitual.

Dictionary Mapping for Functions
================================

In Python we can also include functions or lambdas in our dictionary
mapping:

``` python
def zero():
    return "zero"

def one():
    return "one"

def numbers_to_functions_to_strings(argument):
    switcher = {
        0: zero,
        1: one,
        2: lambda: "two",
    }
    # Get the function from switcher dictionary
    func = switcher.get(argument, lambda: "nothing")
    # Execute the function
    return func()
```

While the code inside `zero()` and `one` are simple, many Python
programs use dictionary mappings like this to dispatch complex
procedures.

Dispatch Methods for Classes
============================

If we don't know what method to call on a class, we can use a dispatch
method to determine it at runtime.

``` python
class Switcher(object):
    def numbers_to_methods_to_strings(self, argument):
        """Dispatch method"""
        # prefix the method_name with 'number_' because method names
        # cannot begin with an integer.
        method_name = 'number_' + str(argument)
        # Get the method from 'self'. Default to a lambda.
        method = getattr(self, method_name, lambda: "nothing")
        # Call the method as we return it
        return method()

    def number_0(self):
        return "zero"

    def number_1(self):
        return "one"

    def number_2(self):
        return "two"
```

Pretty nifty, right?

The Official Answer
===================

The [official
answer](https://docs.python.org/2/faq/design.html#why-isn-t-there-a-switch-or-case-statement-in-python)
says, "You can do this easily enough with a sequence of
`if... elif... elif... else`". And that you can use dictionary mapping
for functions and dispatch methods for classes.

Arguably the official answer doesn't explain anything except for
workarounds. In other words, a "non-answer". In my opinion, what the
official answer is really trying to say is, "Python doesn't need a
case statement."

Really?
=======

Yup. But there's more. I've heard people I respect say that
switch/case statements in code can be really hard to debug.

Personally I find that argument breaks down as soon as you run into
gigantic nested dictionaries used for mapping of code branches. Think
about it, a 100+ element nested dictionary is just as hard to debug as a
nested switch and case block with 100+ cases.

Maybe Dictionary Mapping Runs Faster?
=====================================

Moot as Python doesn't have a case statement. Talking about benchmarks
from other languages is pointless as what is faster in one language is
not always faster in another. Let's move on.

The Significant Advantage of Python's Approach
===============================================

Every once in a while I walk into a scenario where Python's approach
just works better than a switch/case statement. This is when at runtime
I need to add or remove potential items from the mapping. When this
occurs, my years of practice of writing dictionary mappings and dispatch
methods pays off. I have insights now that I never had back in the day
when I relied on switch/case statements.

Closing Thoughts
================

To me, that Python forced me to accumulate lots of practical experience
with mappings is a blessing in disguise. The constraint of not having
switch/case statements allowed me to create approaches and ideas I may
not have developed with it.

Intentional or not, Python's lack of switch/case has been a social
construct that made me a better coder.

Enough so that I think this accidental social construct is a better
answer than the official one of 'Do this instead!'
