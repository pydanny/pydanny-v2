title: Two Scoops of Django 1.8 is Out!
---

I'm pleased to announce the "Early Release" of the [Two Scoops of
Django: Best Practices for Django
1.8](http://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8)
**PDF** ebook.

[![Two Scoops of Django 1.u](images/two-scoops-1.8-ebook-S.jpg)](http://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8)

Co-authored with [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://twitter.com/audreyr),
the [1.8
edition](http://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8) of
*Two Scoops of Django* is filled to the brim with knowledge to help make
Django projects better. We introduce various tips, tricks, patterns,
code snippets, and techniques that we've picked up over the years. What
we didn't know or weren't certain about, we found the best experts in
the world and asked them for the answers. Then we packed the result into
a 500+ page book.

## What's Next?

-   We'll be adding more material to the 1.8 edition in the near
    future, hence the term, "[Early
    Release](http://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-8-faq#what-does-early-release-mean)".
    Everyone who buys the 1.8
    [ebook](http://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-8)
    from us gets all 1.8 ebook updates.
-   Once we're happy with the ebook, we'll release a [print paperback
    edition](http://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-8-faq#what-formats),
    scheduled for mid-to-late May.
-   We'll have a [ebook/print
    bundle](http://roygreenfeld.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-8-faq#will-there-be-a-bundle).
    If you buy the Early Release ebook from us, you qualify for the
    bundle.
