Introduction
============

Years ago, when I was working with [Plone](http://plone.org) at
[NASA](http://nasa.gov), one thing I dreaded was when content editors
would copy-and-paste from Microsoft Word into the title bar. All kinds
of funny characters would appear in the title bar and URL. I would have
to go into the database (ZODB) and fix things. Things didn't get better
until [Reed O'Brien](https://github.com/reedobrien) turned on a title
validator (probably in `Plone.i18n`).

When we started using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com), one thing
that made it nice was the presence of it's
[slugify()](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/utils/#module-django.utils.text)
function and template filter. Inspired by the newspaper industry, this
function it easier on both content editors and software engineers. In
any case, using `slugify()` we completed a number of projects, with
[NASA Science](http://science.nasa.gov/) being the only public one I
worked on.

As much as the `slugify()` function was useful, there were problems. As
I discovered time and time again over the years, it didn't handle
[unicode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). Or rather, it handled
them by simply vanishing non-ASCII unicode characters. For example:

``` python
>>> from django.utils.text import slugify
>>> slugify(u"straße") # German for road
u"strae"
```

If you read German, you'll know that the default Django `slugify()`
function is converting the word 'road' to nonsense. For sites dealing
with internationalization, this won't do. So over three years ago while
at [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/), [Pinterest](http://pinterest.com)
engineer [Dave Dash](https://twitter.com/davedash) created
[unicode-slugify](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicode-slugify). From
then on we could do this:

``` python
>>> from slugify import slugify
>>> slugify(u"straße") # Again with the German word for road
u"straße"
```

What If I'm Not Using Django?
------------------------------

While a very nice tool, this package is dependent on Django's internal
machinery to operate, which is a problem for non-Django users. While we
could use Python's [unicodedata library to resolve unicode to
slugs](http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/5/), wouldn't it be nice if
there was a nicely packaged/tested solution?

Fortunately, such a nicely packaged/tested solution exists, and it's
awesome!

Introducing awesome-slugify
===========================

Created and maintained by [Dmitry Voronin](https://github.com/dimka665),
[awesome-slugify](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/awesome-slugify) is easy
to use and **100% independent from Django**. You call it thus:

``` python
>>> import slugify
>>> slugify.slugify(u"straße") # Yet again the German for road
u'strasse'
```

Works! Hooray!

However, please note that unlike the Django-only **unicode-slugify**
package which preserves the non-ASCII characters, **awesome-slugify**
transformed the German 'ß' into an ASCII substitution of 'ss'. This
is similar to how the popular
[python-slugify](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-slugify) package
works. While this behavior of translating unicode to ASCII might work
for English-only sites, it's not so useful for the rest of the world.
Fortunately, **awesome-slugify** also provides the incredibly useful
`slugify_unicode()` function:

``` python
>>> import slugify
>>> slugify.slugify_unicode(u"straße") # What is it with German Roads?
u'stra\xdfe'
>>> slugify.slugify_unicode(u"straße") == u"straße"
True
```

Using awesome-slugify
---------------------

Rather than describe **awesome-slugify** in paragraph format, here is
working test code ([using pytest which I described
before](/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing.html)) that
explains what we can do:

``` python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_awesome_slugify.py
from __future__ import unicode_literals
import pytest
from slugify import slugify, slugify_unicode

def test_simple():
    txt = "This is basic functionality!!!    "
    assert slugify(txt) == "This-is-basic-functionality"

def test_remove_special_characters():
    txt = "special characters (#?@$%^&*) are also ASCII"
    assert slugify(txt) == "special-characters-are-also-ASCII"

def test_basic_accents_and_backslash_escapes():
    txt = 'Where I've gone before'
    assert slugify(txt) == "Where-Ive-gone-before"

@pytest.fixture
def accents():
    return u'Àddîñg áçćèńtš tô Éñgłïśh íš śīłłÿ!'

def test_accents(accents):
    assert slugify(accents) == "Adding-accents-to-English-is-silly"

def test_keep_accents(accents):
    assert slugify_unicode(accents) == \
                        'Àddîñg-áçćèńtš-tô-Éñgłïśh-íš-śīłłÿ'

def test_keep_accents_lower(accents):
    # Because awesome-slugify doesn't lower() while slugify, we
    #   have to do it ourselves. I'm torn if I like this or hate it
    assert slugify_unicode(accents).lower() == \
                        'àddîñg-áçćèńtš-tô-éñgłïśh-íš-śīłłÿ'

def test_musical_notes():
    txt = "Is ♬ ♫ ♪ ♩ a melody or just noise?"
    assert slugify(txt) == "Is-a-melody-or-just-noise"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt) == "Is-a-melody-or-just-noise"

def test_chinese():
    txt = "美国" # Chinese for 'America'
    assert slugify(txt) == "Mei-Guo"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt) ==  "美国" 

def test_separator():
    txt = "Separator is a word I frequently mispell."
    result = slugify(txt, separator="_", capitalize=False)
    assert result == "Separator_is_a_word_I_frequently_mispell"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
```

Easy to use as any good `slugify()` function!

Restricting the length of a returned slug
-----------------------------------------

When using **awesome-slugify**'s `slugify()` and `slugify_unicode()`
functions, the `max_length` argument acts in an interesting fashion. On
very short strings it removes longer words to make things fit. As the
author of **awesome-slugify** is Russian, and the Russian language, as
far as I know, doesn't have prepositions (words like 'the' and 'a')
this makes sense.

Let's take a look, shall we?

``` python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
# test_awesome_slugify_max_length.py
import pytest
from slugify import slugify, slugify_unicode

def test_max_length_tiny():
    # Removes the longer words to fit smaller words in.
    txt = "$ is a special character, as is #."
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=10) == "is-a-as-is"

def test_max_length_medium():
    # Keeps in prepositions, but removes meaningful words.
    txt = "$ is a special character, as is #."
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=15) == "is-a-special-as"

def test_max_length_realistic():
    # Long enough that long words are not removed from the string in favor 
    #   of shorter words.
    txt = """This sentence illuminates the method that this package
                handles truncation of longer strings.
    """
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=50) == \
        "This-sentence-illuminates-the-method-that-this-of"

# The next few tests cover how the max_length argument handles truncation
#   inside of a word. When working with longer word languages, like German,
#   understanding how your chosen slugify() function works is important.

def test_truncating_word():
    # This demonstrates taking a long German word and truncating it.
    txt = u"Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsaufgabenübertragungsgesetz"
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=40) == \
                "Rindfleischetikettierungsuberwachungsauf"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt, max_length=40) == \
                u"Rindfleischetikettierungsüberwachungsauf"

def test_truncating_varying_letter_size():
    # Truncating unicode slugs is challenging. For example, the German 
    #   letter 'ß' is 'ss' in English. Should a slugify's max_length
    #   argument use the German or the English length? In the case of 
    #   awesome-slugify, it uses the length of English letter for both the 
    #   slugify() and slugify_unicode() functions.
    txt = u"straße" # I really can't stop using German roads.
    assert slugify(txt, max_length=5) == "stras"
    assert slugify_unicode(txt, max_length=5) == u"straß"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    pytest.main()
```

What's Next?
=============

As demonstrated, **awesome-slugify** covers many common use cases.
Nevertheless, in [my next blog
post](/awesome-slugify-human-readable-url-slugs-from-any-string-2.html)
I cover how to write custom language `slugify()` translation functions
using **awesome-slugify**.

**Update 2013/01/23** Thanks to
[flying-sheep](http://www.reddit.com/user/flying-sheep), I Changed
'equivalent' to 'substitution' in describing the unicode-to-ASCII
translation. This is because 'ss' is not a precise translation of
'ß'.
