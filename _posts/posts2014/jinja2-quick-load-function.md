title: Jinja2 Quick Load Function
---

It seems like that for every few weeks I find myself needing to generate
something out of a template while working outside a framework. For this
task, my preferred solution is [Jinja2](https://jinja.pocoo.org/). I've
used Jinja2 to generate HTML, code, and text. If I were brave enough I
would even say I've used it to generate XML (*While my preferred xml
tool is great for parsing, even lxml is not so much fun for XML
generation*).

I frequently use this snippet of code to render templates. Since I'm
tired of digging through my code to find it, I'm placing it here for
personal reference.

``` python
from jinja2 import FileSystemLoader, Environment

def render_from_template(directory, template_name, **kwargs):
    loader = FileSystemLoader(directory)
    env = Environment(loader=loader)
    template = env.get_template(template_name)
    return template.render(**kwargs)
```

Sample usage:

``` python
>>> from simple_script import render_from_template
>>> data = {
...     "date": "June 12, 2014",
...     "items": ["oranges", "bananas", "steak", "milk"]
... }
>>> render_from_template(".", "shopping_list.html", **data)
```

I've thought about packaging this up with
[cookiecutter-pypackage](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage)
and placing it on [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi), but I think it
might be overkill.
