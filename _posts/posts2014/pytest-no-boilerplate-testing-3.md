---

In my previous [blog
post](/pytest-no-boilerplate-testing-2.html) I
covered writing exception-based assertions and fixtures. Today I'm
going to close things out by demonstrating how to change the behavior of
[pytest](http://pytest.org/) and how to integrate it with **Django** and
`setup.py`.

Changing the Behavior of **pytest**
===================================

When **pytest** is called, either via the command-line or by
`pytest.main()`, it [looks for a configuration
file](http://pytest.org/latest/customize.html#how-test-configuration-is-read-from-configuration-ini-files)
called either `pytest.ini`, `tox.ini`, and `setup.cfg`. If it finds a
configuration file, it follows standard practices for those things. In
the following example, I demonstrating searching for tests inside of all
Python files while ignoring the `**_build**` directories:

``` ini
# pytest.ini (or tox.ini or setup.cfg)
[pytest] # You must put pytest-related controls in a 'pytest' block
python_files=*.py  # Run tests against all python modules
norecursedirs = _build # Don't look inside of _build directories
```

Changing **pytest** Behavior Dynamically
----------------------------------------

This is pretty nice, but if I need to ignore certain Python modules like
`setup.py`? I can do this by creating a `conftest.py` module and
defining a `collect_ignore` variable.

``` python
# conftest.py
collect_ignore = ["setup.py", "conftest.py"]
```

The `conftest.py` module can actually be defined per directory. So if
test behavior needs to change in different packages, just create
additional `conftest.py` modules. It's simple to do, but really
powerful.

The `conftest` module is capable of a lot of other things. Right now
there doesn't seem to be a page that documents it in full, so I'm
considering submitting a documentation pull request. In the meantime, I
live off the `conftest.py` [search
results](http://pytest.org/latest/search.html?q=conftest&check_keywords=yes&area=default).

**pytest** is Plug-In Driven
----------------------------

One feature I really like about **pytest** is that much of it's default
capabilities are driven by about 20 plug-ins. It's a sign of maturity
that not only does it have plug-ins, but that most of the time this
feature is transparent. You can add new plug-ins to your project in a
[number of
ways](http://pytest.org/latest/plugins.html#plugin-discovery-order-at-tool-startup),
including `pip` installation from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/).
For locally defined plug-ins I prefer to rely on explicit `conftest.py`
declarations:

``` python
# conftest.py
collect_ignore = ["setup.py", "conftest.py"]
pytest_plugins = ["dream_plugin", "dream.utils.testplugin"]
```

There are a lot of [third-party pytest
plug-ins](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=search&term=pytest-&submit=search),
which brings me to the next major section: Integration with other tools
and frameworks.

Django Integration is Just a Plug-In Away
=========================================

If you want to use **pytest** instead of **Django**'s test runner and
also get the power of function-based tests, fixture functions, improved
test discover, and all the stuff I haven't covered, then check out
and/or `pip` install
[pytest-django](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-django). My
*admittedly brief* usage on some of my existing projects has
demonstrating that my existing **unittest**-style tests work.

That previous tests still function means that as with a pure Python
project, I can rely on existing **unittests** and write all my new tests
as functions. I guess I could say that my existing Django projects just
got much easier to maintain.

A good example of using **pytest** with **Django** can be found in
[django-braces' tox.ini
file](https://github.com/brack3t/django-braces/blob/master/tox.ini).

Twisted (and more) Integration is Just a Plug-In Away
-----------------------------------------------------

The same goes for [Twisted](http://twistedmatrix.com/) thanks to
[pytest-twisted](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest-twisted). There is
also a [Pyramid](http://www.pylonsproject.org/) plug-in that was just
[released](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pytest_pyramid). I'm not sure
if [Flask](http://flask.pocoo.org/) needs it, but I guess there will be
**Flask** plug-in soon.

Integration With `setup.py`
===========================

Fortunately, the documentation for **pytest** covers both adding a new
[setup.py command-classes for
pytest](http://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integrating-with-distutils-python-setup-py-test)
and [actual
integration](http://pytest.org/latest/goodpractises.html#integration-with-setuptools-test-commands).
That's handy, but what I've found even more useful is the [setup.py
that Jeff Knupp wrote for his Sandman
project](https://github.com/jeffknupp/sandman/blob/develop/setup.py).

**Note:** If you aren't experienced with writing Python packages and
readying them for **PyPI**, I recommend you read [Jeff Knupp's blog
post on open sourcing
projects](http://www.jeffknupp.com/blog/2013/08/16/open-sourcing-a-python-project-the-right-way/).
Amongst other things, it has an in-depth discussion about integration of
**pytest** with `setup.py`. Anything I would write on the subject of
`setup.py` integration would be just a cheap knock-off of Jeff's
excellent work.

Summary
=======

Tests are an important part of any project. While they increase the
stability of a project, that unfortunately can come at the cost of the
boredom of writing tests. Fortunately, **pytest** goes a long way to
alleviating that boredom while also empowering Python code authors with
lots of additional useful tools. I'm delighted to have finally
discovered **pytest**. In the short time I've used **pytest**, it's
saved me days, if not weeks, of tedious work.
