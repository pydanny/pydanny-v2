title: I Married Audrey Roy
---

In a small, private family ceremony on December 27th, 2013 I exchanged
wedding vows with [Audrey](http://audreyr.com)
[Roy](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com).

It was an incredible day. I'll savor the moment we promised ourselves
to each other in matrimony forever. She is the other half of my soul,
and since we've become husband and wife, everything has changed. The
world is simply a better place to be.

Audrey wore my mother's 1961 wedding dress and her wedding ring was my
grandmother's. These symbolized the close bond Audrey has with my
family. I was wearing a tuxedo and for the occasion taught myself how to
tie a bow tie. The flowers were a combined effort of Audrey, her aunt,
and her cousin. Audrey made the wedding cake figurines herself.

Honeymoon
=========

We experienced so much of the world in 2013 that we don't feel inclined
to race off to an exotic honeymoon quite yet. We are tentatively
thinking of a road trip in the USA, but are open to suggestions.

Future Celebrations
===================

We're thinking of planning a fun, casual outdoor reception in late
March in Southern California. We're not absolutely certain yet, because
at big events you barely have time to say hello to everyone. Still, it
could be fun...

More Photos
