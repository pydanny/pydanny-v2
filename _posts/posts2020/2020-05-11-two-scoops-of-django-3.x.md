We just released the early release (alpha) of the fifth edition of our book, titled [Two Scoops of Django 3.x](https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x). The 3.x means we are supporting Django 3.0, 3.1, and 3.2 Long Term Support (LTS) releases, ensuring the content will be valid until April of 2024.

On May 11, 2020 the e-book version sells for just **US$42.95**!

At 00:00:01 on May 12th (UTC-8), the price goes up to **$49.95**. Hurry up and get your [book](https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x)!

For now, the e-book is just in PDF format and will be expanded to epub and mobi formats in the days to come. Readers of this alpha version get all the updates and have the opportunity to help us shape the direction of the book through their feedback, and to be credited as contributors.

The book will also be printed, but for several reasons that won't happen until hopefully August of this year. When we get closer to that date we'll take pre-orders and send everyone who ordered an e-book a big discount code.

Due to popular demand, we are selling group licenses of Two Scoops of Django 3.x, in [10 developer](https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x?variant=31920402432087), [50 developer](https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x?variant=31920413737047), and [250 developer](https://www.feldroy.com/collections/two-scoops-press/products/two-scoops-of-django-3-x?variant=31932839297111) packages. These can be found as options in the product selection dropdown.
