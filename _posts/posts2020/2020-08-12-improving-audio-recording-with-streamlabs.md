title: Improving Audio Recording with Streamlabs
type: post
---

Earlier this year I started to [live stream coding efforts on Twitch](https://twitch.tv/danielfeldroy). Soon after, I started posting long and short excerpts of those streams on [my YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/c/danielfeldroy). At first my audio sucked, but it has improved over time.

Here's a typical poor audio example from when I first started:

Ugh! So much background noise! My voices sounds hollow and echoes at times.

# My initial improvements

I did the following:

- Used a better microphone, a [ATR-2100](https://www.amazon.com/Audio-Technica-ATR2100X-USB-Microphone-Podcasting-Headphones/dp/B08667PT7Y?tag=mlinar-20) gifted to us years ago.
- Experimenting with [Streamlabs OBS audio filters](https://obsproject.com/wiki/Filters-Guide#audio-device-filters)

Five days ago I recorded this, and you will be able to hear definite improvement:

Huge difference! Hooray!

# Upping My Audio Game

Today I did the following:

- Found and implemented [Streamlabs' guide for improving mic audio](https://blog.streamlabs.com/how-to-improve-mic-quality-in-streamlabs-obs-de3d16c13871). 
- I also used [Capturing Desktop Audio in Streamlabs OBS for Mac](https://support.streamlabs.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043989634-Capturing-Desktop-Audio-in-Streamlabs-OBS-for-Mac).

My test recordings sound better than before. It won't block entirely block out a fan sitting next to me, but most of the house noises are completely gone.
