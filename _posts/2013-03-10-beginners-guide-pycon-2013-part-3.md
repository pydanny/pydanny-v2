  <h2 id="315-pm-talks">3:15 PM talks</h2>
  <p>
    There isn't a beginner-focused talk in this slot, so I'm going to make this
    the <em>roller-coaster</em> slot. In other words, I'm going to steer you to
    the most intensely advanced talk at this time. Attend, buckle in the safety
    harness, and drink in the extreme knowledge!

        >Making Apache suck less for hosting Python web applications</a
      >
      (Graham Dumpleton) - It is not hard to find developers who will tell you
      that Apache sucks for running Python web applications. Is there a valid
      basis to such claims or have they simply been misguided by the views of
      others? Well, Graham understands how Python serves up web pages and won't
      hold back on technical detail.

      Python syntax that uses the LLVM library and llvmpy to convert
      specifically decorated Python functions to machine code at run-time. It

      that is blazing fast yet tightly integrated with the CPython run-time.

      >
      (Laurens Van Houtven) - Cryptography is a tricky subject, and the goal of
      this 4:15 PM talk isn't to turn attendees into cryptography experts.

      compare, and also a sense for detecting and exposing snake oil.
