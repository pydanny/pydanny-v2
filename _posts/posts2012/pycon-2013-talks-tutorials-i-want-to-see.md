title: PyCon 2013 Talks/Tutorials I want to see
---

This morning, [Jesse Noller](http://jessenoller.com/), the chair of
PyCon US, suggested a meme, "[PyCon 2013](https://us.pycon.org/2013)
**talks/tutorials I'd like to see**". Here is my meme submission:

1. Python Obfuscation Contest
=============================

This **certain-to-be-controversial talk idea** would be where the
speaker would solicit Pythonistas to submit a single arcane
[Python](https://python.org) code module that would have to display the
text of "*Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're
Dutch.*" There would be a '*Expert*' category which would forbid the
eval/exec functions. The "*Anything Goes Category*" would allow use of
**eval/exec**. The conference talk would be where the speaker announces
the winners and comments on the brilliant insanity of submissions.

2. Python in Space!!!!
======================

I want to hear any talk on how Python is used in space exploration or
research. That includes NASA, SpaceX, ESA staffers or citizen
scientists.

3. Template Language Shootout
=============================

I want a benchmark heavy talk on the raw speed of various Python
template systems, complete with hard numbers and pretty charts. This
isn't just a matter of speed, but also a measure of terseness and total
usage. The test code will need to be made public so it can be vetted,
debated, and expanded upon.

4. Python 3 from scratch
========================

I want to see a talk that shows how by using Python 3 from the start,
you content that you got a edge over Python 2.x. This case study should
be as technical as possible and shouldn't have anything do with
migrating from 2.x to 3.

5. Fun and games with NumPy
===========================

[NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/) is an incredible library. It deserves a
talk, specifically one where it is demonstrated to do something amazing.
Maybe it's something scientific, maybe it's something crunching social
data, maybe it's something I can't begin to imagine. Surprise and
impress me!

There you go, my submission of 5 talks to the "[PyCon
2013](https://us.pycon.org/2013) **talks/tutorials I'd like to see**"
meme. What do you want to see?

And now it's time for...

A Public Service Message to the Python Community
------------------------------------------------

Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my
[blog](). I'm here to talk to you about a very
import subject: **Submit your talk early to PyCon US.**

Last year there were hundreds of talks submitted for just a very few
speaking slots. Unpaid volunteers labored for hours before and after
their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get in. The
volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that earlier
submitted talks get more attention.

Don't leave your poor talk or tutorial out in the cold. Help us fix the
problem in one of two ways:

1.  [Submit your talk as early as
    possible](https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp).
2.  [Help review PyCon US
    talks](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/07/i-want-you-for-pycon-program-commitee.html).
