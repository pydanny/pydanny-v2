Resolutions, I like to blog about them.

===========

    Africa, and Australia.

    preferences since the whole world is so exciting.

    or David Beazley.

-   Attend my first Capoeira Batizado (formal gathering).
-   Work out at least three times a week.

-   Have a beer with Thomas, Andy, Andy, Tony, Garrick, Bernd, and the
    rest of Ye Aulde Gange.
