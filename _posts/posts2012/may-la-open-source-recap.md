title: May 12th, 2012 LA Open Source Recap
---

On May 12th, 2012, over 50 [Python](https://python.org),
[C++](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B),
[Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/), [PHP](https://www.php.net/),
[JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) developers arrived to code on a variety of
projects. It was awesome! Tons of open source projects saw
contributions, and people across languages and frameworks worked
together.

## Event Background

Less then two weeks before May 12, a bunch of us Los Angeles area Python
developers were hanging out and wishing we had a local sprint to attend
that was just about developers working on open source projects. It was
then that [Audrey Roy](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com) and I, along with an army
of hardworking volunteers, decided to stop wishing and make it happen on
May 12th.

We lined up a venue, contacted awesome sponsors
[Spire.io](https://spire.io), [Heroku](https://heroku.com),
[Github](https://github.com), [Cars.com](https://cars.com), and
[Cartwheel Academy](https://academy.cartwheelweb.com). As we did that,
we also invited people from the many Los Angeles programming communities
in Los Angeles to join us. The result of everyone's hard work? **We
filled up all sixty spots in less than 96 hours!**

Some of the projects worked on included:

-   Salt Stack: <https://github.com/saltstack/salt>
-   A node.js-powered streaming terminal, allowing for shared input at a
    terminal among several participants.
-   A JavaScript powered astrolabe.
-   Settlers of Catan analytics in JavaScript.
-   [OpenFrameworks](https://www.openframeworks.cc/), a cross-platform
    toolkit for creative coding in C++.
-   My own time at the sprint was spent with Audrey Roy and [Randall
    Degges](https://rdegges.com) on engineering cleanup and fixing bugs
    on
    [OpenComparison](https://github.com/opencomparison/opencomparison).

## More open source sprinting on July 15

There's going to be another Los Angeles open source event on July 15 at
[Originate](https://originate.com/). Instead of less then two weeks to
plan, we have nearly two months - so it's going to be better!
