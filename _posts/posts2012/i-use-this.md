title: I use this
---

I had been meaning to do this for some time, and even had a nascent page
for it on this site already. I just noticed my old friend [Jessica
Hammer](https://jessica.hammer.usesthis.com/) was featured on
usesthis.com. Then I remembered [Kenneth
Reitz](https://kennethreitz.com/) [blogged about his
tools](https://kennethreitz.com/i-use-this.html) not that long ago. Looks
like it is my turn now.

So without further ado, seven of my tools, specifically software.

[TextMate](https://consumernotebook.com/textmate-the-missing-editor-for-mac-os-x/4f4ad4e35a4305000d000000/)
==========================================================================================================

I continue to use it, even though it's unsupported, has weird
whitespace issues, and people make fun of me. I don't mean the
EMACS/Vim people, cause they mock everyone, I mean people using [Sublime
Text
2](https://consumernotebook.com/sublime-text/4f4ad53a5a4305000e000000/),
[PyCharm](https://consumernotebook.com/jetbrains-pycharm/4f4ad5b861e9e4000e000000/),
and NotePad on Windows. I try to make a brave face of it and for the
most part I succeed.

Speaking of which, you know how you sometimes wish deep inside that the
fairy tales of youth were actually true? Or that there was a zombie
apocalypse and you got the chance to show off how all your eclectic
skills and pursuits would make you a survival genius? Well, I feel that
way about TextMates 2 being released in my lifetime. Alas, stark reality
stares me in the face; yet I cling to hope.

Alright, sometimes I dabble in Sublime Text 2. I've played with
PyCharm. In 2010 I even worked on a project where use of
[PyDev](https://consumernotebook.com/pydev/4f4ad5d55a4c6f000d000000/) was
mandatory. When I touch servers it's EMACS, Vi, or even Nano. And yet
to TextMate I always return.

Is TextMate dead? Probably. And yes, someday I'll switch over to
something else, probably Sublime Text 2. In order to be certain I'm
starting to [list all the Python
editors](https://consumernotebook.com/lists/pydanny/complete-list-of-python-editors/)
so I can review them properly before switching.

Keynote
=======

I never liked Powerpoint. I tried to use Google Presentations for years.
Finally I tried Apple's Keynote for presentations and it was an amazing
decision. It's simple, easy, and remains out of my way. To make code
pretty I copy/paste pygmentized code and it just works.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Read the Docs](https://rtfd.org)
================================

> "Wikis are where documentation goes to die."

I'm of the opinion that Python open source projects that don't have
Sphinx documentation are not ready for production use. And if I have to
decide between two projects that are close in capability and one of them
isn't on Read the Docs, then you know which way I'll go.

Why?

Because I want my documentation as up-to-date as possible. Wikis often
fail in this, so do custom documentation solutions, and so does upload
tarballs to a service. You should be using the same patterns for
documentation as you do coding. Use Read the Docs.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Heroku](https://heroku.com)
===========================

When I first heard that Heroku had become yet-another-Python-PAAS, I
shrugged. The field is crowded. We've tried a bunch, but never felt
like committing a real project to this type of service.

After a coding contest in October over in Hollywood where [Randall
Degges](https://rdegges.com) served as sys admin for the project and
tried out Heroku, I was impressed. Heroku provided a nice command-line
interface and had an impressive feature set on it's own. A stand-out
feature I noticed was the [add-ons](https://add-ons.heroku.com), which
are Heroku moderated third-party plug-ins for their service. Finally, it
didn't hurt that Heroku has the staff to provide 24/7 coverage of their
servers.

We decided to give it a try and the results are that [Consumer
Notebook](https://consumernotebook.com) is hosted by Heroku. We're more
than pleased, and I'll be blogging about the advantages of PaaS over
doing-servers-yourself in a future article.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[1Password](https://agilebits.com/store)
========================================

For all my umpteen accounts they all have different, crazy obscure
passwords. All I need to do is remember one password and I've got
access to them. What is even better is that it allows me to look up
passwords in a crowded room - they are kept obfuscated by the password
`****` field. So much better than trying to keep it all in my head, or
relying on weird coding patterns.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

[Consumer Notebook](https://consumernotebook.com)
================================================

Yup, I eat my own dogfood. It lets me [build comparison
grids](https://consumernotebook.com/grids/~pydanny/) or look at what
[other people are
comparing](https://consumernotebook.com/grids/r1chardj0n3s/10-android-tablets/).
I can [list stuff for any
purpose](https://consumernotebook.com/lists/~pydanny/), and turn the
content of those lists into grids. It is still in BETA, so things are
still under development. However, on the other side, since I'm the one
building and using it, I get to determine the features going in or
coming out.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mac OS X
========

I started as an Apple user:

[![Me at 14-ish years of age sitting in from of the Apple 2](images/6933443849_51316a7cb7.jpg)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/6933443849/)

I use Mac OS X professionally and have done so since 2006. However,
between autumn of 1985 and 2006 I used MS/DOS and Windows (deployments
usually to Unix/Linux). Not by choice but by hard reality of management
decision. In September of 2006 as I started to learn Python work gave me
an old, discarded Macbook Pro. Since then coding on OS X and then
deploying on Linux has been my pattern. I've followed this pattern ever
since, and I'm going to hit six years now as an OS X user.
