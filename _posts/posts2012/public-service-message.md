title: A Public Service Message to the Python Community
---

Hi, I'm Daniel Greenfeld. You might know me from my
[blog](). I'm here to talk to you about a very
import subject: **Submitting your talk early to PyCon US.**

Last year there were hundreds of talks were submitted for just a very
few speaking slots. **Unpaid volunteers** labored for hours before and
after their normal jobs reviewing and debating which talks were to get
in. The volume of talks combined with simple reviewer fatigue means that
earlier submitted talks got more attention.

This year, following the pattern of previous years, we're going to have
25% more talk submissions.

Please don't leave your poor talk or tutorial out in the cold.
===============================================================

**Submit early.**

Help us fix the problem in one of two ways:

1.  [Submit your talk as early as
    possible](https://us.pycon.org/2013/speaking/cfp).
2.  [Help review PyCon US
    talks](http://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/07/i-want-you-for-pycon-program-commitee.html).

Production notes for this service message
=========================================

I've always wanted to do one of those TV public service messages done
by B or C grade actors. As a D-grade blogger I thought I might be a
pretty good match for the role. :-)
