title: Los Angeles Open Source Sprint on Nov 4th!
---

[![Hacking awayyy!!](images/la_hackathons.jpeg)](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/)

Yet again, myself, Audrey Roy, and a small but elite cadre of volunteers
are feverishly at work putting together another Los Angeles open source
event. Our [last effort went smashingly
well](/july-15th-2012-la-open-source-recap.html), and
like any good engineer, we're ready to scale up - this time to 150
attendees!

LA Open Source #5 is a day long coding event for Open Source developers
of all languages and skill levels to come and code like fiends. They'll
be joined by dozens of either really smart coders or nice people like
me. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and more!

RSVP at <https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/85658952/>

I'll be there to:

-   Co-lead the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles
    technical community!
-   Code like a fiend. I plan to work on core
    [Django](https://djangoproject.com). Maybe some ember.js stuff too.

And now to open the floor to questions...

## When and where?

Where:

    Cross Campus (crosscamp.us)
    820 Broadway
    Santa Monica, CA

When:

    November 4th, 2012
    10 AM to 9 PM

## Is this like a Hackathon?

Yup. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints>

## What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?

Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join
and contribute to in order to make the world a better place. The current
list of projects include things like:

-   Django - in fact, this time we've got at least one core Django
    developer!
-   Node.js
-   Python
-   Rails
-   Ruby
-   Pyramid
-   Salt Stack
-   Clojure
-   PHP

## I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?

It depends.

**If you've never coded before**, this isn't the right place. Instead,
you might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In
fact, here's a good [bi-weekly hack night / study
group](https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/) for you.

**If you've done a tutorial or two**, sprints can be a great way to
learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced
developers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are
called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for
beginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at
events like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other
things that have made me a better coder.

## Can I come and do one of the following:

-   Recruit.
-   Get people to work on my private project.
-   Get people to work on my start-up idea.

**No.**

This is not a job fair or way to get free developers services, and we
don't want unnecessary distractions.

On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we mention you on the
official event description, in social media and many other perks. To bad this event occured years ago.

In addition, we're considering future events that mix in business into
our efforts. If you're interested in that sort of thing then stay tuned
for more announcements.

## What about sponsorship?

In return for sponsorship we mention your organization or person on the
official event description, and provide many other perks including
mention in social media.

In fact, our attendees are well-noted for their feverish support of
sponsors. Developer-only open source events are rare in Los Angeles, so
attendees are incredibly grateful to those who make the event possible.

If interested, keep in mind this event happened years ago.

## What do I need to bring?

Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers,
the venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to
bring a power strip labeled with your name.

## I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?

The event is $10, covers food and drink for the day, and you can RSVP
