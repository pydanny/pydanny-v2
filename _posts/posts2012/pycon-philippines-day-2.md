title: PyCon Philippines 2012 Day 2
description: A wonderful end to a wonderful event.
---

The second day of [PyCon Philippines 2012](https://ph.pycon.org) had a
really good turnout. My unofficial estimate is that we had about 90% of
the attendees from the first day attend (with the unfortunate exception
of most of the faculty and students of [Agoo Computer
College](https://www.13hq.com/)).

The day started with...

# Lightning Talks

Unfortunately I don't normally take notes on lightning talks. I'm
kicking myself now. **Really hard.** I'll try and relate some of the
talks:

- Import this and [that](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/that), a parody
  talk by Daniel Greenfeld (me). [Malcolm comment on
  it.](https://twitter.com/malcolmt/status/219244338029412352)
- Getting into space using weather balloons by Frank Pohlmann
- [Ponystrap](https://github.com/audreyr/ponystrap) by [Audrey
  Roy](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com) ([video from DjangoCon
  Europe](https://klewel.com/conferences/djangocon-2012/index.php?talkID=31))
- Call for [Tagalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tagalog) and other
  [Philippine
  languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philippine_languages)
  translation of [Django](#django) by Malcolm Tredinnick
- The obligatory PyCon lighting talk on Vim by [Bryan
  Bibat](https://twitter.com/bry_bibat)
- [OpenERP](https://openerp.com/) by
  [Frank](https://twitter.com/PliniusSecundus)
  [Pohlmann](https://www.auberonsolutions.com/) and [Ann
  Tan-Pohlmann](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/ann-tan-pohlmann/4/a30/233)
- A parody talk by [Sony Valdez](https://twitter.com/mrvaldez)

Then it was on to...

# Sprints and Tutorials

> Encouraged at #pyconph seeing so many people declaring themselves

Primary funding for the sprints came from the [Django Software
Foundation](https://www.djangoproject.com/foundation) and [Python
Sprints](https://pythonsprints.com/). That funding went towards food,
drinks, and various logistics for handling the estimated 200+ attendee
turnout. Things sprinted on:

## Django

Django had it's own dedicated and very full room (no more chairs could
fit so I sat on the floor), with Malcolm Tredinnick leading the effort,
with [Marconi](https://marconijr.com/)
[Moreto](https://twitter.com/marconimjr) helping out. It turned into
mostly an effort to get a lot of people kick-started in Django. What was
very heartening was watching people race through the tutorials on their
own, and then work on projects using the framework.

I suspect next year the sprints will see a lot of submissions to Django
core.

I had hoped to continue my work on Class Based View documentation, but
it was wisely pointed out that I should focus more on helping others get
moving in Django and other projects.

## Ansible

[Rodney](https://capsunlock.net) [Quillo](https://github.com/cocoy) led
the sprint on the [Ansible](https://ansible.github.com/) tool of which he
is so fond. About seven people fond of engineering joined him. They
seemed very productive and happy by day's end.

## pymongo

A number of developers working on embedded devices gathered to work out
an edge case issue with pymongo. I wish I knew more about their efforts,
but I can tell you that this sort of very serious engineering effort is
very common amongst professional Filipino developers. Because of
geography, telecommunications and embedded devices are much more
prevalent in the island nation.

## Other efforts

Again I'm kicking myself. There were a ton of other development going
on and I didn't document any of it. Certainly I was busy here and there
helping out, but this is the sort of thing you need to document at the
moment. Next time I assure you I will be very diligent about recording
the efforts of so many.

## Tutorial Room

About half the people stayed in what I dubbed the tutorial room. This is
where speakers took turns going over material we had brought to the
conference. Attendees followed along, and the diligence and focus in the
room was very impressive. The tutorials/talks included:

- Intro to Python using Turtle by Sony Valdez
- Introduction to git and github by Bryan Bibat
- [21 Cool Things You Can Do With
  Python](https://www.slideshare.net/pydanny/intro-to-python-11186202)
  by Daniel Greenfeld (me)

# Food and drinks

I mean to mention that the breakfast, lunch, and snacks at PyCon
Philippines 2012 were pretty good. The logistic chairs had decided
rather than gamble on the usual sort of over-priced and not-so-good
professional catering service that most conferences rely on to the
dismay of... well... everyone, to go with local restaurants.

For dinner people went out on their own. We were lucky enough to go to
Pino in Quezon City both times. The Kare-Kareng Bagnet was really tasty.

# Conference End

The conference chair, Frank Pohlmann, gave us a few well spoken words
about how wonderful the event was to run and host. How gratifying it was
to see the enthusiasm and dedication of the attendees, and how inspired
he felt.

Then we cheered him.

After that it was a lot of pictures and goodbyes to many new friends.
Which meant a lot of sad feelings about a great event coming to an end.
I felt inspired and changed. I wasn't the same person going in as I was
coming out. I'm more grateful for what I have, and deeply honored that
I had this chance to bring PyCon to so many wonderful people.

More thoughts on PyCon Philippines in a forthcoming blog post.
