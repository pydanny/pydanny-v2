[![Coldest Spring](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pydanny/pydanny.github.com/master/static/51hVFnWbG7L.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-Spring/dp/B071P74C8Z/?tag=ihpydanny-20)

Today is a special day. You see, the latest fantasy book I co-authored,
[Coldest Spring (3rd in the Ambria
series)](https://www.amazon.com/Coldest-Spring/dp/B071P74C8Z/?tag=ihpydanny-20),
is out AND it's my birthday. In honor of of these occasions, the first
book of the series, Darkest Autumn, for 0.99 cents on Amazon. Plus, I'm
doing a Python-related giveaway.

**The Giveaway:** There's a python programming easter egg in the book.
One of the characters mentions the elegance of Python. The first person
who tells me in the comments below the name of the father and
grandfather of that character gets an autographed [Two Scoops of Django
1.11
book](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11)
shipping anywhere in the world.

Finally, if you want to give me a truly special present for my birthday,
please review any or all of my books on Amazon. Positive or negative,
every review makes a difference. The positive stuff feeds my already
inflated ego, and the negative stuff tells me what I need to do in order
to improve.

=======

-   July 24th 3pm: A commenter by the name of **@lingot** answered first
    and they'll get the autographed book. However, there is an even
    more precise response than the one they gave. If anyone can provide
    that answer, they get an autographed TSD 1.11 as well. Good luck!
