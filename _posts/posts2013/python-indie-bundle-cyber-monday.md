title: Python Indie Bundle Cyber Monday Sale
---

I've joined forces with Matt Harrison and Audrey Roy to put together
the first ever [Python Indie Bundle](https://www.pythonindiebundle.com)
sale!

This bundle includes the following e-book bundles (PDF, Kindle, ePub)
for just **$24.95**:

-   Treading on Python Volume 1: Foundations
-   Treading on Python Volume 2: Intermediate
-   Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5

Bought individually, these three books would cost you $36.95, but in
honor of Cyber Monday we've chopped off about 33%, bringing you the
awesome price of just **$24.95**!

We're just indie authors who work without a publisher. We pay all the
bills, do all the marketing, and make it or break it on our own. It's a
lot of work, but we think the total control we have over our work speaks
volumes for the quality of result.

If you've been to my blog before, you probably already know about Two
Scoops of Django that I co-wrote with Audrey Roy. However, you may not
know about Matt Harrison's books, so I'm going to share some thoughts:

Matt has a talent for explaining things related to Python. If you are
still new to Python, his books will amplify your skills and get you to
the next level. If you've been doing Python for a while, his
intermediate book will illuminate how things like decorators,
generators, and other great features of Python can be leveraged to make
your code cleaner and faster. In a nutshell, Matt's books pay for
themselves because they ramp up your skills.
