title: Beginner's Guide to PyCon 2013 Part II
---

This is Part II in a series of blog posts about [PyCon US
2013](https://us.pycon.org/2013/). The goal is to provide a handy
reference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest
[Python](https://python.org) conference. [Part
I](/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html) was
mostly about [tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/),
this post will be about registration and the first day of talks.

Registration
============

If you haven't done so yet, please
[register](https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/) now. Last
year PyCon sold out way in advance, and hundreds missed the event. Which
is a shame, because the conference is awesome!

Keep in mind that the money you spend on registration will go towards a
very good thing. You see, after the costs for running PyCon are
subtracted, the rest will go to the non-profit Python Software
Foundation ([PSF](https://python.org/psf/)). In addition to supporting
the Python language itself, the PSF provides financial aid and grants
for aspiring developers around the world. Which means the money you
spend registering for PyCon will literally change people's lives. This
isn't an idle exaggeration, this outreach has made a difference for
you, me, and arguably the world. I would love to say more, but that's
an article for another day...

Alright, on to the talks!

Talk Attendance Guidelines
==========================

At PyCon, talks are either 30 or 45 long. They represent the best and
brightest in both old hands in the community and rising stars. Some
quick guidelines:

-   **Ask Questions!** If the speaker leaves time for questions at the
    end, [go and
    ask](https://cecinestpasun.com/entries/i-can-haz-question-or-five/)!
-   **Shut the Laptop and Turn Off the Device.** It's disconcerting to
    give a speech to hundreds of people staring at their portable
    electronics and not responding to your banter. Unless you are using
    electronics to actively take notes on the talk, consider turning
    them off to look at the speaker.
-   **Don't Heckle.** It's nerve wracking going up in front of
    hundreds of people live and tens of thousands on streaming video.
    Heckling is **never** funny and it's a good way to lose friends and
    make enemies. Unless the speaker asks for commentary during the
    talk, wait until the end and then ask your questions.

Alright, that out of the way, let's take a look at what Friday, March
15th, has to offer in terms of beginner friendly talks...

Friday Morning
--------------

The registration desk opens at 7:00 AM. Breakfast begins at 8:00 AM.
From 9:00 AM to 10:20 AM is the welcome and initial keynote speeches.
PyCon keynotes aren't boring - **they are crazy awesome!**.

In selecting these talks, I've tried to focus on the more technical
ones.

### 10:50 AM talks

-   [How to Except When You're
    Excepting](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/35/)
    (Esther Nam) - One of the rising stars of the community, Esther
    works for a group that demands 100% test coverage. She's going to
    cover the fundamentals of writing tests and why tests are a good
    thing.
-   [How the Internet
    works](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/50/) (Jessica
    McKellar) - Want to know how the internet actually works? Jessica
    McKellar (also giving two tutorials and a keynote speech) will use
    Python to help you understand what's really going on.
-   [Gittip: Inspiring
    Generosity](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/116/)
    (Chad Whitacre) - Gittip is an open source Python platform for
    sustaining open source development via small, anonymous donations.
    This is a technical case-study about the story of community.

### 11:30 AM talks

-   [Scrapy: it GETs the
    web](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/135/) (Asheesh
    Laroia) - In 2009 I took a web scraping tutorial by the author. He
    impressed me with his energy and knowledge. While technically this
    is an **intermediate** talk, I know everyone will get something out
    of this talk

### 12:10 AM talks

-   [API Design for Library
    Authors](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/39/) (Chris
    McDonough) - Well designed APIs are critical for how other
    developers interact with your code. Chris is one of the talents in
    the community when it comes to creating easy-to-use but extremely
    powerful tools. I'm delighted he's made this an introductory talk.

Friday Lunch
------------

Quick notes:

1.  Don't forget to keep your PyCon meal tickets you got when you
    registered in the morning or they won't let you into the lunch
    room!
2.  Sit down to people you don't know and introduce yourself. Every
    time I do this I don't just get to meet interesting people, I get
    to meet **amazing** people. PyCon is full of brilliant minds and
    you'll never get to know any of them unless you try.

Friday Afternoon

Got lunch? Time for more talks!
