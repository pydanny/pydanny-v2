title: Off to Europe!
---

I feel like I'm dreaming, but **we're on our way to Europe!**

A few weeks [Audrey](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com) and I decided to move. While
looking at possible rentals or even mortgages, we were idly (dreaming
really... still paying off debts incurred from last year) looking at
how much a room/apartment would cost to rent in Europe. To our surprise,
we found a lot of good options that cost less then it would to pay
monthly rent/mortgage in Los Angeles.

**o_O**

Then, we discovered an amazing travel deal. It combined a very cheap
red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale, and a slow
trans-atlantic ship from Port Miami to Barcelona, about as much as a
cheap hotel but with free food! If we avoid alcohol and any extra fees,
it's actually extremely inexpensive. Being mostly disconnected from the
internet would mean we could really focus on a couple of critical
projects. If only we had a business justification for going to
Europe...

**It just so happens that we have business in Europe.**

Our plan is to spend a few months in Europe before returning back to the
USA. We'll work hard on the ship, work hard when we arrive, and just
get stuff done. It's not a vacation, but it is Europe, and there is
such a thing as weekends.

We'll be spending a few days in early May in Barcelona, then making our
way to Poland for several weeks. Yes, we're attending [Django
Circus](http://djangocircus.com), plus I want to investigate some family
roots. After Poland, we're thinking either France, Italy, Hungary,
England, Belgium, Scotland, Ireland, and other options. We'll see where
the winds and affordable AirBNB places take us.

When do we go back? Well, we plan to stay for at least two months. Even
if we go back to the USA, we would have at least been in Europe for May
and June. How cool is that?

We could have talked ourselves out of going. We nearly did. However,
even with our workload this is the chance of a lifetime.

Finally, for the next two weeks I'll only be able to access the
internet for a few minutes per day. Please expect my responses to emails
and tweets to be slower than normal.

**Update:** In the middle of all of this, I was invited to keynote
Django Circus:
