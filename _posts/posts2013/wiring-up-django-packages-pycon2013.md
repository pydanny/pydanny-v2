This is a 3+ hour [PyCon

Tutorial Description
====================

Django is part of an ecosphere of over 20,000 packages, which can be
leveraged to great effect. This tutorial will teach the evaluation, use,
and extension of third party Python and Django applications in your
projects. This tutorial will be a lecture with a lot of detailed and
annotated code examples.

::: {#PyCon}
This tutorial does much more than instruct on how to wire in third party
packages, it also instructs on Django/Python best practices such as
PEP-8, loose coupling, good database design, clarity of concept, and
workable patterns.

Material covered:

-   Evaluating packages using Django Packages, PyPI, Read the Docs, and
    other sources.
-   Must-include packages for every project
-   Class-based Views
-   Forms
-   Models
-   Caching
-   Comments
-   Templates
-   Admin

Format
======

This will be a lecture with detailed and annotated code examples.
Attendees will have a chance per section to ask questions and submit
alternative packages of their own.
