    A few months ago me and my fiancee,
    <a href="http://audreymroy.com" target="_blank">Audrey Roy</a>, launched our
    start up,
    <a href="http://consumernotebook.com" target="_blank">Consumer Notebook</a>.
    It's a Python powered product comparison site that combines the best
    features of
    <a href="http://opencomparison.org" target="_blank">Open Comparison</a>,
    Yelp, Consumer Reports, and Pinterest. We've worked day and night to make it
    better, with countless members of the Python community using the site and
    giving us invaluable feedback.
  </p>
  <p>
    All of that brings us to
    <a href="http://us.pycon.org/2012/" target="_blank">PyCon</a>. We're not
    just here as attendees and participants, but also to promote our startup. It
    used to be the cool thing to launch your startup at SXSW, but times have
    changed. Now it's the cool thing to launch at PyCon!
  </p>
  <p>
    Like Twilio, Twitter, Facebook, and Google, we've got an
    <a href="http://api.consumernotebook.com" target="_blank">API</a> we want
    developers to use. And as an upcoming startup, we've got to really be
    creative in how we gain your attention, so here is what we're doing for
    PyCon 2012:

  <p>Thanks PyCon!</p>
  <p>
    We've got a booth on Saturday. We've got banners and bright red track
    jackets. We're giving out handy API reference cards, as well as 10 different
    <a

      target="_blank"
      >flavors of Oreo cookies</a
    >
    (see our site for a complete list of every Oreo cookie flavor, by the way).
  </p>
  <p>
    So stop on by, sign up for the BETA, have a cookie, and talk to us about our
    API. For that matter, feel free to talk to me or Audrey about the API any
    time you see us. We're wearing bright red jackets with '<strong
      >Ask me about our API</strong
    >' on our back.
  </p>
  <p>Speaking of the API, the next item on our plan is...</p>

  <p>
    We've put together the Consumer Notebook
    <a href="http://api.consumernotebook.com" target="_blank">API</a>, which
    lets you get product list and comparison data out of our site via a simple
    REST interface.
  </p>
  <p>
    We're kicking off our PyCon 2012 API launch with an
    <a
      href="http://developers.consumernotebook.com/contest "
      target="_blank"
      >API contest</a
    >.
  </p>
  <p>
    You have from now until April 22 to find new and exciting ways to use our
    <a href="http://api.consumernotebook.com" target="_blank">API</a>. If you
    win we'll give you a Kindle Fire or equivalent gift certificate valid in
    your nation of origin.

    We've hired professional Hollywood stuntman and Capoeira instructor to the
    stars,
    <a href="http://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7" target="_blank"
      >Contra Mestre Xingu</a
    >, to come up from Los Angeles to lead this event. In addition to appearing
    in movies, videos, and commercials, he's got first hand experience with
    snakes. In his own words:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>
      Capoeira saved my life. What? How? Well it was a sunny afternoon, I was
      shooting a film in the Hollywood hills off Coldwater Canyon at a house. I
      was running back to set from the bathroom and out of nowhere a rattlesnake
      jumped up from the ground and tried to bite me. I quickly jumped out of
      the way and did a fast negative
      <a
        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_capoeira_techniques#Rol.C3.AA"
        target="_blank"
        >rolé</a
      >
      away from the snake. Then I called the other people on set and we caught
      it. I really didn't think much of it afterwards until after the shoot. My
      friend told me the rattlesnake was a young one and I'm lucky I didn't get
      bitten. When a younger rattler bites you, it usually unloads all of it's
      venom in you because it cannot control the amount it releases.
    </p>

    Over 30 people have signed up up for this event, including Python core
    developers.
