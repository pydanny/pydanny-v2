[![BitCoin and Two Scoops of Django!](/images/bitcointsd111.png)](/25-percent-bitcoin-sale-two-scoops-of-django.html)

Like the title of this blog post says, for Bitcoin purchases we're
offering a 25% discount for purchases of [Two Scoops of
Django](https://www.roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11).
That puts the ebook version at $34.36 and the autographed hardcopy at
$38.36. Pretty awesome, right? If you want to take advantage of this
awesome deal, the Bitcoin discount is applied during checkout.

Combining the Bitcoin Discount With the Bulk Discount
=====================================================

Yes, the Bitcoin discount can be combined with [bulk
orders](https://www.roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-11?variant=42846677327).
So if you order 15 books or more, you get both the 20% bulk discount and
the 25% bitcoin discount. That means each book is bought at $28.77
versus $47.95! Furthermore, bulk orders are shipped free to anywhere in
the world. This makes it an incredible deal for companies,
organizations, and user groups.

Stay tuned!
