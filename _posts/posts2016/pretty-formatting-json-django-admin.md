title: Pretty Formatting JSON in the Django Admin
---

Recently I was writing code to interact with a third-party API. The API
changes frequently, especially the data contained in responses. However,
that data has to be saved and periodically needs to be audited. I wanted
a data model flexible enough to handle these periodic changes without a
lot of anguish, yet queryable. Since the API serves out queryable JSON,
this made it a no-brainer for using `django.contrib.postgres`'s
JSONField.

After a little bit of work, I had data samples to play with. Quickly my
admin filled with chunks of JSON that looked something like this:

``` bash
{"field_12": 8, "field_16": 4, "field_6": 14, "field_7": 13, "field_18": 2, "field_2": 18, "field_4": 16, "field_15": 5, "field_9": 11, "field_3": 17, "field_8": 12, "field_11": 9, "field_17": 3, "field_10": 10, "field_0": 20, "field_1": 19, "field_13": 7, "field_5": 15, "field_14": 6}
```

Kind of illegible, right? And that's a simple, flat example with just
20 keys. Imagine if this were a nested dictionary with 100 or 200
fields. For reference, that's the kind of data that I had that makes
this kind of display nigh useless.

So I cooked up this quick fix:

``` python
import json
from pygments import highlight
from pygments.lexers import JsonLexer
from pygments.formatters import HtmlFormatter

from django.contrib import admin
from django.utils.safestring import mark_safe

from .models import APIData


class APIDataAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
    readonly_fields = ('data_prettified',)

    def data_prettified(self, instance):
        """Function to display pretty version of our data"""

        # Convert the data to sorted, indented JSON
        response = json.dumps(instance.data, sort_keys=True, indent=2)

        # Truncate the data. Alter as needed
        response = response[:5000]

        # Get the Pygments formatter
        formatter = HtmlFormatter(style='colorful')

        # Highlight the data
        response = highlight(response, JsonLexer(), formatter)

        # Get the stylesheet
        style = "<style>" + formatter.get_style_defs() + "</style><br>"

        # Safe the output
        return mark_safe(style + response)

    data_prettified.short_description = 'data prettified'

admin.site.register(APIData, APIDataAdmin)
```

The field remains the same, but we also get a display of nicely
formatted data:

Much better!

There may be a package out there that does this already, perhaps even
using a JavaScript library like hightlight.js instead of pygments. If
not, it shouldn't be hard to create one using [Cookiecutter Django
Package](https://www.pydanny.com/how-to-create-installable-django-packages.html).
Let me know if you package this and I'll add it to this blog post.
